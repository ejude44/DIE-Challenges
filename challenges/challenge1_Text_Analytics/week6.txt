12 -  Social Aspects of learning(social network analysis

This chapter was focused in the analysis, transformation and visualization of tidytuesday data(interactions- tweets).

Data: #tidytuesday data(tweets) - Network Data

Operations on data: Transformation and Visualization.

In procesing the data, an edgelist was created. An edgelist is a dataset where each row is a unique interaction between two parties. Each row which respresents a single relationship is called an Edge.

The aim is understanding interactions among #TidyTuesday participants.

some new vocabulary introduced are: Application Programming Interface (API),
edgelist, edge, influence model, regex, selection model, social network analysis, sociogram, vetex and some functions: rtweet, randomNames, tidyr, tidygraph, ggraph

The aim of this chapter was to use social media data from the #tidytuesday hashtag to prepare and visualize social network data.

The count of sender and receiver(all_mentions) were stored
the counts of the edgelist(conversation)
some charts used for the visualisation includes: Network graph with centrality to calculate the centrality of each individual using the built in centrality_authority() function.

it was indeed fun as usual. a good experience overall.
