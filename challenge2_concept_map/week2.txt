Chapter 8 - Walthrough 2(gradebook data)- Review
Data type - Classworks and GradeBook Data.
Dataset  type- Table(contains several columns like student name, running average, letter grade, homeworks, classworks, formative assessments, project scores etc )
Operations on Dataset - read,   rename, handling missing Data, Data frame creation, visualization.

Ideas- other research Questions
Mulitple regression analysis- Gr = B1 + B2 Gr1 + B3 
Grade relationship Gender
Grade relationship Gender + financial
Formative assement relates HW, Class work and project Grades......
FA relates Grades

                             Summary
In this chapter, gradebook(also an educational dataset) data was used.  some new vocabulary introduced in this chapter includes: correlation, directory, environment, factor level, linear model, linearity, missing values, ouliers, string.

After importing the excelgradebook data, some funtions operated on it includes; rename, remove_empty,select, pivot_longer.



After the data cleaning step, the data was visualized using ggplot: some charts used includes: bar chart(geometric bar), box plot(geometric boxplot).


There was also a check for linearity using a scatter plot to for example find if there is a relationship between overall grade and formative assessments. 

Also using ggplot2 and scatter plot to find line of best fit. The strength of the relationship between the two variables denoted by the correlation coefficient.

Box plot were used detect outliers in the formative assessment or overall grades.

it was overall fun and quite insghtful as new techniques were learnt.
